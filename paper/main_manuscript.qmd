# Introduction

1. Research question
How does the level of national economic development, measured by GDP per capita, affect smoking prevalence between 1990 and 2019?

2. Literature relevance and gaps/strengths

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) provides standardized country-level estimates of smoking prevalence and number of smokers for more than 200 countries from 1990 to 2019.

Economics and public health scholars have shown that GDP per capita is correlated with both individual tobacco use and the stringency of tobacco control policies.

To date, no comprehensive panel data analysis has been able to reveal when and to what extent growth in national income has driven changes in smoking prevalence and total number of smokers over time.

3. Previous research and improvement

Previous research:
GBD collaborators mapped global smoking prevalence trends and estimated the number of smokers from 1990 to 2019.

Improvements:

Combined the historical dataset of GBD smoking prevalence and number of smokers in 2019 with the annual per capita GDP series to capture the co-evolution over time. Investigated how income growth trajectories affect smoking prevalence in different economic contexts, and explored whether economic development accelerates or suppresses the smoking trend and the growth of the smoker population.

# Data and Methods

Brief description and collection method:

The original data come from two publicly available sources. 

The first is the GBD 2019 Smoking Tobacco Use Prevalence dataset, which provides annual, country-level estimates of smoking prevalence  and total number of smokers for over 200 countries from 1990 to 2019. 

The second source is the World Bank GDP per capita series, reporting annual GDP per capita (current US $) for the same set of countries, drawn from official national-accounts data and standardized for cross-country comparability.

Collection time:

Data collection covers the period from 1990 to 2019

Dataset size:

The data is divided into two parts:

GBD 2019 Smoking Prevalence contains 24,000 data

World Bank GDP per capita data series contains 5,800 data

Generalizability:

These data cover more than 200 countries between 1990 and 2019 and are well suited for analyzing the relationship between economic growth and smoking behavior. 

However, model-based estimates of smoking prevalence may be less accurate in regions where survey data are sparse. Similarly, GDP per capita data may misrepresent true economic activity in countries with variable data quality.
